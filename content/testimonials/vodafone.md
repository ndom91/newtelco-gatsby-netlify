NewTelco – is one of the most reliable and responsible partner Vodafone works with on European market and globally. The level of support is extremely high, and speed for order completion is outstanding – probably the best in the industry. NewTelco – is a great team of intelligent people that really cares about the customer. NewTelco engineers are knowledgeable and experienced, very helpful and can resolve requirements for remote hands support, equipment installation and configuration, service testing, etc. Would strongly recommend NewTelco as a reliable partner.
