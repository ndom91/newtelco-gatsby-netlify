NewTelco’s strategically located data centre in Frankfurt am Main (Kleyer Strasse 88 / Rebstoecker Strasse 25-31) offers state-of-the-art colocation facilities for equipment housing – providing our customers with direct access to the largest European telecommunication hub and a total of 450+ network operators, ISPs content providers and other telcos.

Apart from Frankfurt am Main, NewTelco also provides colocation services at a number of different locations worldwide: Amsterdam, Cape Town, Hong Kong, London, Stockholm, Vienna and many more. These also include Johannesburg, Kiev and Tbilisi, where NewTelco owns its own data centres.

All NewTelco’s premises have been built, designed and constructed in accordance with the very latest VDE standards, guaranteeing an excellent climate for innovation, high quality electrical and electronic products and optimal technical conditions for all the equipment and systems installed at our data centres locations.

Furthermore, our data centres – which are our main area of focus – are operated based on ISO standards, offering comprehensive protection of our customers’ critical and sensitive data, a holistic, risk-based approach to data security and a compliance guarantee.

NewTelco provides direct access to a range of leading network providers and carriers. All our customers are free to select the network of their choice from those available onsite, whilst direct and low latency dark fibre availability, high capacity optical wave lengths and layer2 access to other data centre locations provide inter-connections to networks and equipment located elsewhere.

NewTelco’s containment concept considerably improves computer room cooling efficiency, resulting in significant reductions in energy costs. Maximum energy efficiency is achieved by totally separating the warm and cold aisles.

Whether our customers require rack space, their own footprint and cabinets, caged areas, AC/DC redundant power or simple in-house cabling, NewTelco’s team of highly trained and qualified colocation experts offers customizable services geared to responding to carrier-specific needs in a highly individualized manner.
